This project is used to store our dat to day login credentials in MongoDB which is document oriented database where data is stored in documents.
How this works???
1. User need to create an account by useing mail id. A six digit OTP will be sent to registered mail
2. After creating user has to login to add/retrive/update your credentials in DATABASE
3. If User wants to read all data he/she needs to verify their accont by validating the OTP which will be sent to registerd mail id
